## A1

A1 include 2 questions:

**Q1: PyTorch 101**. Walk you through the basics of working with tensors in PyTorch.

**Q2: k-Nearest Neighbor classifier**. Walk you through implementing a kNN classifier. 

## A2

A1 include 3 questions:

**Q1: Linear Classifiers**. Walk you through implmenting SVM and Softmax classifier.

**Q2: Two-layer Neural Network**. Walk you through implementing a two-layer neural network-based classifier.

**Q3: MNIST Challenge**. Walk you through the challenge problem where you will manually set the weights of a Two-layer Neural Network classifier and evaluate on MNIST hand drawn digits. This interesting notebook encourages you to rely on your intuition to achieve the desired results.
