## A1

A1 include 2 questions:

**Q1: PyTorch 101**. Walk you through the basics of working with tensors in PyTorch.

**Q2: k-Nearest Neighbor classifier**. Walk you through implementing a kNN classifier. 

**The goals**:

* Develop proficiency with PyTorch tensors
* Gain experience using notebooks on Google Colab
* Understand the basic Image Classification pipeline and the data-driven approach (train/predict stages)
* Understand the train/val/test splits and the use of validation data for hyperparameter tuning
* Implement and apply a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier
* Learn how to test your implementation on Autograder

## A2

A2 include 3 questions:

**Q1: Linear Classifiers**. Walk you through implmenting SVM and Softmax classifier.

**Q2: Two-layer Neural Network**. Walk you through implementing a two-layer neural network-based classifier.

**Q3: MNIST Challenge**. Walk you through the challenge problem where you will manually set the weights of a Two-layer Neural Network classifier and evaluate on MNIST hand drawn digits. This interesting notebook encourages you to rely on your intuition to achieve the desired results.

**The goals**:

* Implement and apply a Multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier
* Implement and apply a Softmax classifier
* Implement and apply a Two-layer Neural Network classifier
* Understand the differences and tradeoffs between these classifiers
* Understand how a Two-layer Neural Network can approximate an arbitrary function
* Practice implementing vectorized gradient code by checking against naive implementations, and using numeric gradient checking

## A3

A3 include 2 questions:

**Q1: Fully-Connected Neural Network**. Walk you through implementing Fully-Connected Neural Networks.

**Q2: Convolutional Neural Network**. Walk you through implementing Convolutional Neural Networks.

**The goals**:

* Understand Neural Networks and how they are arranged in layered architectures
* Understand and be able to implement modular backpropagation
* Implement various update rules used to optimize Neural Networks
* Implement Batch Normalization for training deep networks
* Implement Dropout to regularize networks
* Understand the architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks and get practice with training these models on data
